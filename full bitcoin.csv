"WHY IS DOLLAR DYING?  2008 Fed printed $4.5 Trillion to save rich. 2020 Fed will have to print $6-8 Trillion, maybe more to save  US economy. There is only $9.5 Trillion in gold in WHOLE WORLD.

"The argument of ""the Bitcoin halving is priced in"" is dumb.

If incoming daily supply drops 50%, then you would need a 50% drop in daily demand as well to keep the same price.

Good luck if your thesis is built on the idea that demand for Bitcoin is going to drop 50%.",Mon Apr 06 12:51:25 +0000 2020,1641,285
